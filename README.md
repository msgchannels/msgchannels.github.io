# Testing Media Urls Page

This is a Github page set up for the purposes of testing sending different media types. Mostly, it will focus on media that is not readily available publicly online (like badly formatted, corrupted, or just plain wrong files).

### Structure

File types should be grouped together in folders.

### On Page

Media links should be structured with a Heading and in an unordered list

```
    <h1>FILE TYPES</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href=" PATH TO THE FILE OR URL ">filename.type</a></li>
                <li><a href=" PATH TO THE FILE OR URL ">filename.type</a></li>
                <li><a href=" PATH TO THE FILE OR URL ">filename.type</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
```
